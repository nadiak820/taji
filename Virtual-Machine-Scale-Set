**************************************************
Increase CPU utilization

stress --cpu 80

************************************

By the way, you can stress your system by cpu, memory, io, hdd, or a combination of them. You can get a list of options and parameters in manpage as well.

Example 1:
Bring the system load average up to an arbitrary value for cpu. In this example, it forks 4 processes with calculating the sqrt() of a random number acquired with rand() function.

stress -c 4
or
strss --cpu 4  --timeout 15

"--timeout 15" means timeout after 15 seconds

*******************************************************************************************
Example 2:
To see how your system performs when it is I/O bound, use the -i switch.

stress -i 4
or
stress --io 4

This will call sync() which is a system call that flushes memory buffers to disk.
Of course, you can combine above commands like:

stress -c 4 -i 4 --verbose --timeout 15 

Example 3:
Now, let's try memory stress. The following command forks 7 processes each spinning on malloc():

stress -m 7 --timeout 15
or
stress --vm 7 --timeout 15
